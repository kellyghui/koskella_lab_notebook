# September

--Start of Week--
## 9/22/25
- Started 99TK O/N

## 9/23/25
- Used 99TK O/N grown up from yesterday
- 99TK: Plated the -6,-7,-8 dilutions
- Took old glycerol stock of PT23 (1 of 5), put it on ice, and used inoculation loop to grow in KB (i just scooped an arbitrary amt in)
- PT23: Plated the -4,-5,-6 dilutions
- Leaving on counter for 2 days

## 9/24/25
- Claire starting PT23 O/N for phage amplification

## 9/25/25
- Started FRS phage amplification with PT23
- Diluted O/N culture in fresh medium, but bacteria did not grow up enough in the 2 hours so we ran out of time, restarting tomorrow
- Started O/N from single colony for 99TK and PT23 for glycerol stocks on Friday

## 9/26/25
- Media contaminated, restart O/N cultures and phage amplification next week

--End of Week--

--Start of Week--
## 9/29/25
- Make 99TK, PT23 O/N for the glycerol stocks (using single colony from old old glycerol stock plated 9/23)
- Phage amplification for FRS (3 hour amplification time) + filter

## 9/30/25
- Make glycerol stocks from 99TK, PT23 O/N (made 3 stocks for each strain)

# October

## 10/1/25
- Claire start O/N 99TK, PT23 using glcyerol stocks from yesterday, for titer

## 10/2/25
- Soft agar overlay 99TK, PT23 to titer FRS 
- plated dilution series of -5 to -8 for phage FRS (duplicates of each)
- plated 1 negative control for 99TK and PT23
- left in incubator to grow overnight  

## 10/3/25
- Check plates </br>

- No observable difference in susceptibility to FRS like previously predicted (phage knocked down both to the same order of magnitude)
- Phage PFU of undiluted culture

| Strain | PFU/mL undiluted culture |
|--------|---------|
| 99TK   | 5.8 × 10⁹ |
| PT23   | 4.5 × 10⁹ |
