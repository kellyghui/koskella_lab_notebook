# September

## 9/22/25
- Started 99TK O/N

## 9/23/25
- Used 99TK O/N grown up from yesterday
- 99TK: Plated the -6,-7,-8 dilutions
- Took old glycerol stock of PT23 (1 of 5), put it on ice, and used inoculation loop to grow in KB (i just scooped an arbitrary amt in)
- PT23: Plated the -4,-5,-6 dilutions
- Leaving on counter for 2 days

## 9/24/25
- Claire starting PT23 O/N for phage amplification

## 9/25/25
- Started FRS phage amplification with PT23
- Diluted O/N culture in fresh medium, but bacteria did not grow up enough in the 2 hours so we ran out of time, restarting tomorrow
- Started O/N from single colony for 99TK and PT23 for glycerol stocks on Friday

## 9/26/25
- Media contaminated, restart O/N cultures and phage amplification next week

## 9/29/25
- Make 99TK, PT23 O/N for the glycerol stocks
- Phage amplification

## 9/30/25
- Make glycerol stocks from 99TK, PT23 O/N

## 9/27/25
- Claire start O/N 99TK, PT23 for soft agar overlay for phage titer

## 9/28/25
- soft agar overlay 99TK, PT23 to titer FRS
- wideee dilution series

## 9/29/25
- Check plates
