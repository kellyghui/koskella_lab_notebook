# September

--Start of Week--
## 9/22/25
- Started 99TK O/N

## 9/23/25
- Used 99TK O/N grown up from yesterday
- 99TK: Plated the -6,-7,-8 dilutions
- Took old glycerol stock of PT23 (1 of 5), put it on ice, and used inoculation loop to grow in KB (i just scooped an arbitrary amt in)
- PT23: Plated the -4,-5,-6 dilutions
- Leaving on counter for 2 days

## 9/24/25
- Claire starting PT23 O/N for phage amplification

## 9/25/25
- Started FRS phage amplification with PT23
- Diluted O/N culture in fresh medium, but bacteria did not grow up enough in the 2 hours so we ran out of time, restarting tomorrow
- Started O/N from single colony for 99TK and PT23 for glycerol stocks on Friday

## 9/26/25
- Media contaminated, restart O/N cultures and phage amplification next week

--End of Week--

--Start of Week--
## 9/29/25
- Make 99TK, PT23 O/N for the glycerol stocks (using single colony from old old glycerol stock plated 9/23)
- Phage amplification for FRS (3 hour amplification time) + filter

## 9/30/25
- Make glycerol stocks from 99TK, PT23 O/N (made 3 stocks for each strain)

# October

## 10/1/25
- Claire start O/N 99TK, PT23 using glcyerol stocks from yesterday, for titer

## 10/2/25
- Soft agar overlay 99TK, PT23 to titer FRS 
- plated dilution series of -5 to -8 for phage FRS (duplicates of each)
- plated 1 negative control for 99TK and PT23
- left in incubator to grow overnight  

## 10/3/25
- Check plates </br>

- No observable difference in susceptibility to FRS like previously predicted (phage knocked down both to the same order of magnitude)
- Phage Titer: 

| Strain | PFU/mL undiluted culture |
|--------|---------|
| 99TK   | 5.8 × 10⁹ |
| PT23   | 4.5 × 10⁹ |

--End of Week-- 

--Start of Week--

# 10/6/25
- streak a couple plates of PT23 from new glycerol stocks (started from single colony)

# 10/8/25
- pick 8 colonies, grow in 24 well plate (grew in 2500 uL each well/2.5 mL)
- Used loops to pick because couldn't find toothpicks, some of the loops kind of fell out and I didn't see any drops fly into the other wells or anything but maybe some microparticles did
- put on shaker outside
- Brandon + Claire colony PCR on ancestral PT23 + 99TK (from glycerol stocks) to confirm it is the correct strains

# 10/9/25
- dilute back to OD 0.2
- 8 biological replicates with 3 technical replicates across 4 conditions (no phage, 10^3, 10^5, 10^7) - I added 10^-4, 10^-2, undiluted FRS respectively according to picture below: </br>

- cultures initially grew up to around OD 1.5 - 1.6
- I had to dilute it alot, only pipetted around 10 uL culture into well w 190 uL KB to get it to around 0.2
- Maybe a little bit of culture mixed when I ripped the tape off the bounced and kinda hit the lid and came out the sides
- Final OD before phage mix in on black plate reader:
