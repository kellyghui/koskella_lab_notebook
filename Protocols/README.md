## Making rif

### Materials
- methanol
- 2 tiny tubes
- rif (from -20 freezer)
- 0.22 uM filter
- syringe
- 10-1000 filtered uL pipette

### Procedure

1. Measure out rif on weigh boat (0.2 g)
2. Pipette out methanol into tiny tube (4000 uL)
3. Shaker for 5 mins or until mixed
4. Cover syringe with 0.22 uM filter
5. Pipette rif solution into syringe (w filtered tips)
6. Push syringe, catch filtered rif with new tiny tube

## Sterilize Beads

### Procedure
1. Strain out ethanol in fume hood
2. Soak in 10% bleach for 10 mins in glass beaker
3. Pour bleach into waste container
4. Then pour milliQ water over beads (must be performed under fume hood), thoroughly rinsing in MilliQ H2O using strainer
5. Strain
6. Rinse in 70% ethanol
7. Strain
8. Spread only one layer deep in large sterile petri dishes in fume Hood
9. Turn on UV and let dry under UV for 1+ hour or overnight
10. If not dry, turn off UV and let dry until completely dry
11. Fill a 50mL conical up halfway with dried beads 
12. Loosely tighten lid and apply autoclave tape
13. Keep upright using empty tip container
14. Autoclave using dry cycle (gravity) , liquid cycle is ok too

## Liquid Contamination 

1. Pour contaminated liquid in waste container in fume hood
2. Pour bleach (~ 1:9 ratio)
3. Let it sit for around 30 minutes
4. Pour out in fume hood
5. Wash the original container with hot water, spray with ethanol

## Overnight Culture

### Materials
1. 2 erlenmeyer flasks
2. KB broth
3. Inoculation loop
4. Foil
5. Ice bucket + ice

### Procedure
1. Pour some KB in both flasks (don't go past half way)
2. Leave one flask as negative control
3. Take out old glycerol stock / whatever medium
4. If glycerol stock, put on ice before taking to BSC
5. Use inoculation loop, scoop a little stock, drop in KB
6. Tape down in incubator, put on shake, foil in top

## Making Glycerol Stocks

### Materials
1. Cryo tube

### Procedure
1. Make the 50% glycerol solution by diluting 100% glycerol in dH20
2. Add 500 μL of the overnight culture to 500 μL of 50% glycerol in a cryo tube
3. Vortex it
4. Pop in -80

## Phage Amplification
### Materials
1. O/N culture
2. 150 mL erlenmeyer
3. P1000 + tips
4. P200 + tips
5. conical tube + tube rack
6. 0.45 uM filter
7. syringe
8. 50 mL tubes (if centrifuging is needed)

### Procedure
1. Grow overnight culture bacteria
2. Dilute O/N culture in fresh medium 1:100 dilution (500 uL in 50 mL)
   - you can just fill approx to 50 mL line - but use a larger glass (150 mL erlenmeyer) so its more aerated 
3. Grow to OD 0.1-0.3 +- 2h or until turbid enough
4. Add phage in 1/500 dilution (100 uL to 50 mL)
5. Incubate until lysis, check every half hour till full lysis is observed
6. Divide into 50 mL tubes, centrifuge 4000 rpm/15 min (if soln is cloudy and needs separation)
7. Place 0.45 uM filter on the syringe tip, and put it over the conical tube
8. Push syringe down to filter with 0.45 uM filter (get rid of all bacteria)
   - if not centrifuged, sometime dead cell particles get stuck in filter 
9. Titer with double agar to get concentration

## Phage Titer
### Materials
1. 24 well plate
2. Soft Agar
3. HA Plates
4. Serological Pipette
5. P1000 + tips (for bacteria)
6. P200 + tips (for phage)
7. Phage Buffer
8. Media Reservoir
9. Phage + PT23 culture

### Protocol
1. Label hard agar plates (2 plates per dilution) + negative control (negative control is just soft agar + bacteria)
2. Make phage dilution series (900 uL phage buffer + 100 uL phage culture)
3. For dilutions you want to plate, take 100 uL phage and pipette one drop on one side of plate
4. On other side of the plate, pipette 300 uL PT23
5. Use serological pipette to pipette some SA and drip it into the HA plate swirling the plate in the process
6. Let dry

## Streaking Assay To Determine Susceptibility

1. Drip x uL phage down a square plate (4 lines per plate?)
2. Streak a colony horizontally across phage line
3. If colony dies then it's still susceptible
