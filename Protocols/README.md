## Making rif

### Materials
- methanol
- 2 tiny tubes
- rif (from -20 freezer)
- 0.22 uM filter
- syringe
- 10-1000 filtered uL pipette

### Procedure

1. Measure out rif on weigh boat (0.2 g)
2. Pipette out methanol into tiny tube (4000 uL)
3. Shaker for 5 mins or until mixed
4. Cover syringe with 0.22 uM filter
5. Pipette rif solution into syringe (w filtered tips)
6. Push syringe, catch filtered rif with new tiny tube

## Sterilize Beads

### Procedure
1. Strain out ethanol in fume hood
2. Soak in 10% bleach for 10 mins in glass beaker
3. Pour bleach into waste container
4. Then pour milliQ water over beads (must be performed under fume hood), thoroughly rinsing in MilliQ H2O using strainer
5. Strain
6. Rinse in 70% ethanol
7. Strain
8. Spread only one layer deep in large sterile petri dishes in fume Hood
9. Turn on UV and let dry under UV for 1+ hour or overnight
10. If not dry, turn off UV and let dry until completely dry
11. Fill a 50mL conical up halfway with dried beads 
12. Loosely tighten lid and apply autoclave tape
13. Keep upright using empty tip container
14. Autoclave using dry cycle (gravity) , liquid cycle is ok too

## Liquid Contamination 

1. Pour contaminated liquid in waste container in fume hood
2. Pour bleach (~ 1:9 ratio)
3. Let it sit for around 30 minutes
4. Pour out in fume hood
5. Wash the original container with hot water, spray with ethanol

## Overnight Culture

### Materials
1. 2 erlenmeyer flasks
2. KB broth
3. Inoculation loop
4. Foil
5. Ice bucket + ice

### Procedure
1. Pour some KB in both flasks (don't go past half way)
2. Leave one flask as negative control
3. Take out old glycerol stock / whatever medium
4. If glycerol stock, put on ice before taking to BSC
5. Use inoculation loop, scoop a little stock, drop in KB
6. Tape down in incubator, put on shake, foil in top

## Making Glycerol Stocks

### Materials
1. Cryo tube

### Procedure
1. Make the 50% glycerol solution by diluting 100% glycerol in dH20
2. Add 500 μL of the overnight culture to 500 μL of 50% glycerol in a cryo tube
3. Vortex it
4. Pop in -80

## Phage Amplification

1. Grow overnight culture bacteria
2. Dilute O/N culture in fresh medium 1:10 dilution (total vol 2 mL)
3. Grow to OD 0.1-0.3 +- 6h
4. Add phage in 1/100 dilution (20 uL to 2 mL), incubate until next step is ready
5. Grow bacteria from O/N in 100-200 mL medium on a falcon tube with breath seal until OD 0.1-0.3
6. Incubate until lysis
7. Divide into 50 mL tubes, centrifuge 4000 rpm/15 min
8. Filter with 0.45 uM filter
9. Titer with double agar to get concentration

## Phage Titer
1. ..

## Streaking Assay To Determine Susceptibility

1. Drip x uL phage down a square plate (4 lines per plate?)
2. Streak a colony horizontally across phage line
3. If colony dies then it's still susceptible
