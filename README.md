# Reduced Bacterial Growth Assays 

This assay aims to quantify the infectivity of bacteriophages using bacterial growth curves. We are currently using two versions of this project. 
- **Version 1**: Checks for internal variability within biological + technical replicates, both with and without phage.
- **Version 2**: Optimizes the starting concentration of phage and quantifies the timepoint of maximum virulence. <br><br>

# Version 1

## Day 1

### Procedure
1. Pipette 90 uL KB broth into 96 well plate
2. Grab freezer stock of DC3000, and scrape about 20 uL into an empty well
3. Pipette 10 uL of DC into broth, dilute to appropriate concentration
4. Plate <br><br>

## Day 2

### Procedure
1. Pick 8 colonies into a 24 well containing ~2 mL of KB broth <br><br>

## Day 3

### Procedure
1. Split the 96-well plate into halves: one with phage, one without.
2. Pipette each row of biological replicates into a media reservoir.
3. Transfer liquid from reservoir to a 96-well plate.
4. Back dilute to a starting density of 0.2-0.3.
5. Pipette ~180 µL bacteria and ~10 µL phage <br><br>

# Version 2 

## [Day 1](#day-1)

## Day 2

### Procedure
1. Pick 4 colonies into a 24 well containing ~2 mL of KB broth <br><br>

## Day 3
honestly maybe just insert a picture of the set up that would be easier <br><br>
