# Reduced Bacterial Growth Assays 

This assay aims to quantify the infectivity of bacteriophages using bacterial growth curves. We are currently using two versions of this project. Version 1 checks for internal variability within biological + technical replicates, both with and without phage. Version 2 optimizes the starting concentration of phage and quantifies the timepoint of maximum virulence.

## Version 1

### Day 1

### Procedure
1. Pipette 90 uL KB broth into 96 well plate
2. Grab freezer stock of DC3000, and scrape about 20 uL into an empty well
3. Pipette 10 uL of DC into broth, dilute to appropriate concentration
4. Plate

### Day 2

### Procedure
1. Pick 8 colonies into a 24 well containing ~2 mL of KB broth

### Day 3

### Procedure
1. split 96 well into 1/2 containing phage and 1/2 not containing phage
2. pipette each row of biological replicates into a media resevoir
3. transfer a small amount of liquid from reservoir into a 96 well
4. back dilute until you reach starting density of 0.2-0.3
5. pipette ~180 uL bacteria, and ~10 uL phage 


## Version 2

[Go to Day 1](#day-1)

### Day 2

### Procedure
1. Pick 4 colonies into a 24 well containing ~2 mL of KB broth

### Day 3
honestly maybe just insert a picture of the set up that would be easier
